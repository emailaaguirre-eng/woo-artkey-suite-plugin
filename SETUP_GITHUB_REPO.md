# Setting Up the New GitHub Repository

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `woo-artkey-suite-plugin` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "WordPress plugin for WooCommerce Art Key products with QR code generation"
4. Choose **Private** or **Public** (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Plugin Folder

Open terminal/command prompt in the `plugin-repo` folder:

```bash
cd path/to/plugin-repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Woo Art Key Suite plugin"
```

### Step 3: Connect to GitHub

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/woo-artkey-suite-plugin.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

After cloning/pulling the repo, always run:

```bash
composer install
```

This installs the QR code library.

## Important Notes

### What's Included in This Repo

✅ **DO commit:**
- `woo-artkey-suite.php` - Main plugin file
- `composer.json` - Dependency definitions
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `SETUP_GITHUB_REPO.md` - This file

❌ **DON'T commit:**
- `vendor/` directory (too large, regenerated by `composer install`)
- `composer.lock` (optional - regenerated)

### Your Main Website Repo Stays Separate

Your existing `tAE-Full-Site` repository remains unchanged. This plugin repo is completely independent and will be installed in WordPress separately.

---

## After Setting Up

1. **In your WordPress site:**
   - Clone this plugin repo to `wp-content/plugins/woo-artkey-suite/`
   - Run `composer install` in that directory
   - Activate the plugin in WordPress admin

2. **In your React frontend (tAE-Full-Site):**
   - Make API calls to the WordPress REST endpoints provided by this plugin
   - No changes needed to your main website repo

---

## Testing

After installation, test that:
- Plugin activates without errors
- WooCommerce products show Art Key options
- REST API endpoints are accessible
- QR code generation works (check error logs if needed)
